            <h2>About Me</h2>
            <p>Hello! I'm Ki, a passionate coder and a hobbyist mathematician. I know HTML, CSS, JavaScript, PHP, and other programming languages, and I love to dive into math problems whenever I get a chance. Coding isn't just my profession; it's something I do for fun, solving problems, creating cool projects, and making things work smoothly.</p>
            <p>When I’m not coding, you’ll probably find me crunching numbers, solving puzzles, or thinking of ways to improve my projects. I’ve always been fascinated by how things work, which led me to programming and math. In my spare time, I like to experiment with new coding techniques and learn more about how things interact in the digital world.</p>

            <h2>Old Joe Bush</h2>
            <p>Let me introduce you to my classmate, Old Joe Bush. Despite the nickname, she’s actually just like everyone else in our class. I call her "Old Joe Bush" as a playful joke—she’s not actually old, but she really dislikes the nickname! It’s a funny bit that always manages to annoy her, but of course, it’s all in good fun.</p>
            <p>Even though I like to tease her with the nickname, Old Joe Bush is a fantastic person. She’s smart, reliable, and has a great sense of humor. She takes it all in stride, even if she acts like it bothers her sometimes!</p>
            <p>If you ever meet Old Joe Bush, you’ll understand why the nickname has stuck, and why it always makes everyone laugh when I use it.</p>
