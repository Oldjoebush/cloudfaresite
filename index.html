            <h2>About Me</h2>
            <p>Hello! I'm Ki, a passionate coder and a hobbyist mathematician. I know HTML, CSS, JavaScript, PHP, and other programming languages, and I love to dive into math problems whenever I get a chance. Coding isn't just my profession; it's something I do for fun, solving problems, creating cool projects, and making things work smoothly.</p>
            <p>When I’m not coding, you’ll probably find me crunching numbers, solving puzzles, or thinking of ways to improve my projects. I’ve always been fascinated by how things work, which led me to programming and math. In my spare time, I like to experiment with new coding techniques and learn more about how things interact in the digital world.</p>

            <h2>Old Joe Bush</h2>
            <p>Let me introduce you to my classmate, Old Joe Bush. Her name might suggest she's ancient, but trust me, she’s as young as anyone else in our class. The nickname? Well, that's a little joke I like to pull on her because she *really* hates it! I call her "Old Joe Bush" to annoy her, and let's just say, it works every time. It’s a nickname that has no basis in reality, but it definitely gets a rise out of her. It’s all in the name of good fun!</p>
            <p>Despite the playful banter, Old Joe Bush is an awesome person. She's smart, funny, and very reliable. But I can't help but have a little fun with the nickname! No hard feelings though, she knows it's all part of the joke, even if she tries to pretend she doesn't care.</p>
            <p>So, if you ever hear me talk about Old Joe Bush, just know that it's all for a laugh. If you're ever lucky enough to meet her, you'll see exactly why the nickname sticks.</p>
